# Motivations
While I can do Hackerrank problems and write codes in a jupyter notebook for my data analysis, I am nowhere near fluency nor maximize the utilization of Python. Many of the data stacks are built using Python (think Airflow for ETL, Flask with RESTful API support for Front-end, scikit-learn for Machine Learning). I want to be more fluent in Python and gain proficiency in building Machine Learning models using Python. 

# Strategy - Deliberate Practice
I found my old way of studying by just following tutorials blindly and doing Hackerrank is not enough. Hackerrank is a great platform to brush up the algorithm solving skills and practice writing snippets of code. But when it comes to learning other Software Engineer practices, Hackerrank seems to be not enough. Then I came across [Robert Chang’s Python-deliberate-practice github](https://github.com/robert8138/python-deliberate-practice) and realized the need to have a better structured plan with clear goals. Generally saying that 10,000 hours to master a skill can be true, but you will need deliberate practice. 

I learned the most by doing, and working on projects. While there are not many opportunities on the job at this point in time, I consider my time outside of work as my side hustle to up the game. Some of the transferable skills from work can come in handy here, especially when it comes to project management.
- Figure out the objective of the projects
- Define the key milestones 
- Estimate the time needed and come up with a schedule

Some guideline from Freecodecamp on How to Use Deliberate Practice to LearnProgramming More Efficiently can be found in this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-deliberate-practice-to-learn-programming-fast/): 
- Deconstruct and analyze desired skills
- Have stretch goals
- Focus and Attention
- Practice
- Review and get feedback

# Objectives
*Immediate*
- Learn to write pythonic code, know how to use git and GitHub

*Short term*
- Write reusable, modular, with unit-test code

*Medium term*
- Program basic Machine Learning models
- Develop an app deploying Machine Learning model 

*Long term*
- Write tools/ frameworks. Being able to work on projects that span the full stack using Python, apply good software engineer principles to these projects.


# Key Results/ Project idea
